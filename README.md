# OpenMenu
This is an open source iCloud OpenMenu code that I wrote awhile ago, this uses MITM proxy instead of Fiddler proxy. This no longer works due to an apple patch, if anyone wants to fix it? I would appreciate it.

NOTE: THIS CODE DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE (APPLE PATCHED THE ORIGINAL METHOD AND I HAVE NO TIME TO PLAY AROUND TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX IT)

Since this is FREE!! and people are trying to rip you off $30 to $50 dollars all i ask is a small donation if you use my tool!

If you would like to #Donate for my #OpenSource tools for #Icloud and other stuff, I have setup a few ways.
